MiniMax Entropy Models.

## Author
This program was created by [Giuseppe Marra](https://www.giuseppemarra.com/about-me/) and his collaborators.

## About

The current implementation is developed on top of the Relational Neural Machines, first introduced by Giuseppe Marra, Michelangelo Diligenti, Francesco Giannini, Marco Gori and Marco Maggini from the Department of Information Engineering of the University of Florence and from the University of Siena.

# Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your PC.

Moreover, to facilitate the use of the application, a Makefile has been provided; to see its functions, simply call the appropriate help command with [GNU/Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

 ```bash
 make help
 ```

### 1. Clone the repository

 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/samuelebortolotti/rnm.git
 cd rnm
 ```

### 2. Install the requirements

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note**: it might be convenient to create a virtual environment to handle the dependencies.
> 
> The `Makefile` provides a simple and convenient way to manage Python virtual environments (see [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)).
> In order to create the virtual environment and install the requirements be sure you have the Python 3.9 (it should work even with more recent versions, however I have tested it only with 3.9)
> ```bash
> make env
> source ./venv/rnm/bin/activate
> make install
> ```
> Remember to deactivate the virtual environment once you have finished dealing with the project
> ```bash
> deactivate
> ```

### 3. Generate the code documentation

The automatic code documentation is provided [Sphinx v4.5.0](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/).

In order to have the code documentation available, you need to install the development requirements

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
```

Since Sphinx commands are quite verbose, I suggest you to employ the following commands using the `Makefile`.

```bash
make doc-layout
make doc
```

The generated documentation will be accessible by opening `docs/build/html/index.html` in your browser, or equivalently by running

```bash
make open-doc
```

However, for the sake of completeness one may want to run the full Sphinx commands listed here.

```bash
sphinx-quickstart docs --sep --no-batchfile --project unsupervised-domain-adaptation --author "Giuseppe Marra, Samuele Bortolotti"  -r 0.1  --language en --extensions sphinx.ext.autodoc --extensions sphinx.ext.napoleon --extensions sphinx.ext.viewcode --extensions myst_parser
sphinx-apidoc -P -o docs/source .
cd docs; make html
```

> **Note**: executing the second list of command will lead to a slightly different documentation with respect to the one generated by the `Makefile`.
> This is because the above listed commands do not customize the index file of Sphinx. This is because the above listed commands do not customize the index file of Sphinx.
